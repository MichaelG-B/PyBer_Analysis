# Purpose
After having completed our original anaylsis in order to better understand how the ride sharing company Pyber could improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods we were tasked with summarizing the data by city type, and creating a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each type as well.

# Results

# How is each city-type unique?
# Ride sharing data:
## Total Rides:
  - Based on total rides the Urban city type reigned supreme with 1625 rides, 3x the number of Suburban rides and 15x the number of Rural rides.
## Total Drivers:
  - The city type with the most drivers was the Urban city type with 2405 drivers. Suburban was second with 490 and last was Rural with 78 drivers.
## Total Fares:
  - The city type with the most fares was again the Urban city Type with $39,854.38, next was Suburban with $19,356.33 and last was Rural with $4,327.93.
  - All three city types experience a sharp increase towards the end of February, however the Urban city type continues to experience spikes during the month of March whereas Suburban and Rural decrease and plateau during march. In April Rural experiences a sharp increase at the beginning of the month, Suburban also experiences a spike but towards the middle of the month. The Urban city type during the month of April starts on a high but slowly decreases over the course of the month.
## AVG Fare per Ride:
  - Due to a rather small market the Rural city type had the highest AVG fare per ride at $34.62, next was Suburban at $30.97 and last was Urban at $24.53
## AVG Fare per Driver:
  - Again due to the rather small market competition the Rural city type had the highest AVG fare per Driver at $55.49, next was Suburban at $39.50 and last was Urban at $16.57.

# Summary
## Three Business recommendations based on disparities between City types.

- If the CEO's goal is to improve access and affordability to underserved communities, then focus should be given to the Rural community as these drivers conduct the highest rate of rides, riders pay the heaviest fares, and this city type has the smallest market share of Pyber's services. Therefore with this goal in mind I would reccomend investing more into these Rural drivers in order to incentivize an increase in the availability of Pyber's services, thereby combatting over-worked drivers, expensive rides for consumers, and increasing markitability in these regions.
- Another reccomendation would be to ease tension in the Urban city type, due to the very competitive market drivers in these regions are facing. This easement could be down by allocating funds for more advertisements or perhaps discounted rides that way more drivers have a chance at obtaining more rides, eliminating this "crabs in the bucket" market.
- Lastly another reccomendation I would suggest to the CEO of Pyber would be to pay special attention to the time periods of each city type's success, meaning during the weeks Urban, Suburban and Rural drivers obtain the most rides conduct strategies to maximize profit. These strategies could be similar to those previously mentioned such as increased advertisements or discounted rides, but they could also be providing higher pay to drivers during the moments of increased demand in the different city types thereby casting the widest net for the most successful periods.
